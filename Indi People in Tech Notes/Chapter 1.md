## **Chapter Synopsis**

### **Defining Technology**

- _technology_ is a relatively new term, first published in the 1820’s by Jacob Bigelow (Harvard University)
- the word _technology_ can be traced back to the Greek language, where it can be broken down into 2 parts:

- _tekne_ meaning the art of doing/making something… it didn’t refer to an object (a noun), but rather a craft or skill (a verb)
- _logos_ originally meaning “informed discourse or debate”, and later simply “knowledge” 

- technologies have historically been invented to help us do things we otherwise couldn’t accomplish, thereby making up for our lack of other traits; as a species, we’re not particularly strong, or fast, and we can’t fly, or breathe under water, but we can use our imagination and create technology
- our ability to create and use technology sets us apart from non-humans; in particular, our ability to engage in abstract thought (imagination, creativity, and abstraction have allowed us to create technologies)
- our reliance on technology dates back 100’s of thousands of years to the early period of simple tool technologies (tools made of stone, bone and wood… knives, scrapers, arrow heads, lodge pools, etc.)
- As Marshall McLuhan said: “First we shape our technologies, and then they shape us,” …this reflects the _reciprocal relationship_ between our technologies and our social organization/behaviours

- technologies have made the survival of the human race possible

### **Technology:** _A system based on the application of knowledge, manifested in physical objects and organization forms, for the attainment of specific goals_

- Technology is a _system_ comprised of the following elements:

- artifacts (cars, cameras, computers, candles, calculators, couches…)
- knowledge (the knowledge required to design and make technologies)
- technique (the skills required to use and maintain technologies, or sometimes _technique_ refers to a way of doing something which may not necessarily involve a technological artifact of any kind; e.g., crop rotation methods
- organization (the social relations required to maintain technologies)
- try to identify several examples of social relationships bound-up with e.g., the private automobile

- Volti’s definition of _technology_ has its limitations:

- it assumes technology comes about in order to meet existing needs… this is not always the case
- the history of technology is littered with examples of inventions looking for problems to solve; e.g., aspirin
- new technologies often create new needs and new problems
- goals achieved through technology are not always practical ones satisfying pressing human needs; e.g., new technologies often developed as status symbols, or frivolous entertainment    

### **Technological Advance and the Image of Progress**

- the development of technology is an inherently _dynamic and cumulative process_

- technological change is one of continuous improvement of existing technologies
- this dynamic, progressive element of technology makes it a unique human endeavour (unlike other human endeavours such as art, literature, and music where it is hard to measure ‘progress’)   

- some societies may be advanced technologically but not in other areas such as the distribution of goods and services and the delivery of social justice

- Nazi Germany developed the Mercedes and other impressive technologies, but murdered millions of Jews
- pre-literate societies had simple technologies, but advanced artistry and social relationships

- the notion of _progress_ is complex and can only be understood in the context of a given set of cultural beliefs and values

### **Technology as a Metaphor**

- _technology_ has been employed as a metaphor; e.g., technology as social progress
- technology has shaped the way we think about ourselves and our world; e.g., the technological principle of _feedback_ (e.g., James Watt’s _flyball governor_ designed to automatically regulate the speed of a steam engine) has been incorporated into other areas of social life; e.g., the stock market; policy analysis, etc.

### **Technology and Rationality**  

- a _technologically progressive society_ has come to mean one in which problems can be managed in a rational way… can be studied systematically and where solutions to problems can always be found
- however, rational modes of thought do not necessarily confer moral superiority

- in fact, extreme rational thought can result in tragic moral transgressions (e.g., Nazi Germany and the Holocaust)

- rationality requires objectivity

### **Technological Determinism**

- a theoretical perspective re: social change which assigns priority to technological factors
- promotes the idea that technological development is out-of-control… technology has a ‘life of its own’
- there is no doubt that technology does impact on individuals and society, but the direction and pace of technological development is influenced by many social, economic, political (etc.) factors
- _Social Constructivism_ is the theoretical perspective re: social change which assigns priority to socio-cultural factors and human agency

### **Living in a Technological Society**

- modern technology is accessible in some form to the entire population yet, by its very nature, few people actually understand it; our lack of understanding can render us somewhat powerless over our technologies and feeling somewhat alienated. Can you think of examples of technologically-induced alienation in your own life?

## **Review Questions**  _Remember: Review Questions are used when setting examination questions_

1. Define _technology_ (identify its principal components). What are some of the limitations of this definition? 

2. The word “technology” comes from the ancient Indo-European word _tekhn_. Describe the evolution of this word from its Greek roots to its first modern application. 

3. Reliance on today’s advanced technologies has been criticized as being “unnatural”. Is this a fair criticism? Why or why not? 

4. Why is _social_ _organization_ considered to be an essential component of technology? Give an example of a _complementary relationship_ between social organization and technology. 

5. How does the history of high-speed aircraft illustrate the process by which new technologies emerge? 
	- This process is exemplified by the development of the modern airplane. Early biplanes with their drag-inducing wires and struts could not make effective use of more powerful engines. The availability of these engines became a strong inducement to the design of aerodynamically cleaner aircraft. The faster aircraft that resulted from the marriage of streamlined airframes and powerful engines produced a new problem: dangerously high landing speeds. This, in turn, stimulated the invention of wing flaps and slots. By the 1940s it had become apparent that improved airframes could achieve still higher speeds if provided with more powerful engines; this possibility gave a strong stimulus to the development of the turbojet.
6. For the incandescent light bulb to be a commercial success there had to be a complementary structure in place to support it. What were the key elements of the system that Thomas Edison created? 

7. How does the history of the pen exemplify some key aspects of technological change? Explain the transition from the _organic_ to the _industrial_ and how it represents overall technological change. 

8. What is a _sigmoid curve_? How is the curve relevant to the course of technological change? 

9. Give an example of a technology that seems to embody progress. According to what standards may it be deemed progressive? 
	Rockets
10. Give an example of a technology where its contribution to overall progress is ambiguous at best. 
	Does maintaining a “life” of this sort justify expenditures that otherwise might be used for expanded prenatal care or other preventative measures? Given all of the value judgments, ambiguities, and complexities surrounding the word “progress,” its use is avoided here unless its meaning is clearly defined.
11. What, in a technical sense, is meant by “feedback”? Note a particular technology that makes use of the feedback principle. Give an example of how “feedback” has entered the social realm. 

12. What is meant by _rationality_? How is it connected to the development of technology? How does it relate to the way Max Weber used the word “disenchantment”? 

13. What is meant by _technological determinism_? What is meant by _social constructivism_? Why is neither fully adequate to the task of describing the nature of technology?

## Chapter Notes

### Nature of Technology
- Recent technological developments have presented us with such marvels as spacecraft leaving the solar system, instant access to billions of Internet Web pages, and diseases cured through gene therapy
- At the same time, however, the seemingly inexorable march of technology has produced global pollution, overpopulation, and the threat of nuclear annihilation. On many occasions technological change has also produced social disruptions, as when automation destroys jobs in a particular industry or a new weapon upsets the balance of power between nations
- when technologies fail, some of them do so in a big way, as exemplified by the loss of the Challenger and Columbia space shuttles, the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the catastrophic failure of the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan, and the disastrous breaching of the levees in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina
- But this support of technology is based more on faith than on understanding. When confronting technology, most of us are poorly informed spectators, seemingly incapable of understanding an esoteric realm of lasers, microprocessors, gene splicing, and nanomaterials.
### Defining Technology

- The linguistic roots of the word “technology” can be traced to the IndoEuropean stem tekhn-, which seems to have referred to woodworking. It is the source of the Greek word tekne, which can be variously translated as “art,” “craft,” or “skill.” It is also the root of the Latin word texere, “to weave,” which eventually took on the larger meaning of fabrication or construction.
- By the early eighteenth century the word had come close to its present meaning when an English dictionary defined it as “a Description of Arts, especially the Mechanical.” In 1831 Jacob
- As he defined it, technology consisted of “the principles, processes, and nomenclatures of the more conspicuous arts, particularly those which involve applications of science.”
- Technologies are developed and applied so that we can do things not otherwise possible, or so that we can do them cheaper, faster, and more easily. The capacity of human beings to employ technologies sets us apart from other creatures.
- Reliance on technology is as old as humanity itself. Whatever evils have accompanied the use of particular technologies, it is pointless to indict technology as being somehow “unnatural.”
- Our past as well as our future as a species is inextricably linked to our capacity to shape our existence through the invention and application of implements and techniques that allow us to transcend our meager physical endowments.
- It is necessary to add some elements to our definition of technology that go beyond the usual identification of technology with pieces of hardware and ways of manipulating them
	- 1. The first of these is organization. This follows from the fact that the development, production, and employment of particular technologies require a group effort.
		- For a technology to be developed and used, the energies and skills of many individuals have to be combined and coordinated through some organizational structure
	- 2. When technology is seen as a combination of devices, skills, and organizational structures, it becomes natural to think of it as a system, the next element in our definition.
		- But by itself, a light bulb was useless. An effective electrical generator was needed to supply the current that produced the incandescence of the filament. A network of electrical lines had to be strung up between the generator and individual homes, shops, and factories. And metering devices were necessary so that users could be accurately billed for the electricity they used. Edison and his associates worked out all of these problems, and in so doing brought large-scale electrical illumination to the world.
			- I.e. Thomas Edison realized just a lightbulb was useless if no one had access so he devised a system of wires, meters and generators t connect people to a grid introducing large-scale electrical illumination 
		- for technological advance often entails the resolution of tensions that are generated when one part of the technological system changes.
- Much of what has just been said can be incorporated into a schematic definition of technology: a system created by humans that uses knowledge and organization to produce objects and techniques for the attainment of specific goals
	- Much of what has just been said can be incorporated into a schematic definition of technology: a system created by humans that uses knowledge and organization to produce objects and techniques for the attainment of specific goals
	- a new technology may in fact create its own needs
- Two hundred years ago, the standard writing instrument was a goose-quill pen. Based on an organic product and sharpened by the user, it represented the handicraft technologies typical of its time. Cheap and crude, it called for a fair degree of skill if it was to be used effectively. In contrast, the steel-nib pen of the nineteenth century was a typical artifact of the industrial age, the product of a complex manufacturing process. Less adaptable than the quill, it was mass-produced in many different forms in order to meet specialized needs. Although Mumford’s ideas were formulated before the invention of the ballpoint pen in the 1940s, his analysis fits this implement perfectly. Made from a variety of artificial materials and manufactured to close tolerances, the ballpoint pen could only be produced through sophisticated industrial processes. It is completely divorced from the organic world and requires very little skill from its user. Indeed, the technological artistry embodied in the pen itself stands in sharp contrast to the poor quality of the writing that so often comes from the hand that wields it.
### Technological Advance and the Image of Progress
- The development of technology is an inherently dynamic and cumulative process. It is dynamic because a technology is never perfect; there is always room for improvement.
- Note that at first the curve rises rather slowly, inclines steeply in the middle, and then begins to slow down. That is, after an initial period of slow growth, the rate of advance accelerates, reaches a maximum, and then begins to proceed at a slower pace but never completely levels off. Although the rate of increase is smaller as the curve moves toward the right, this rate is applied to an increasingly larger base, so the actual addition is still substantial.

- The dynamic and cumulative nature of technological change sets it apart from many other human endeavors. Ignoring for the moment the social consequences of technology, the process of technological change is usually one of continuous improvement in the internal workings of a particular technology: as they evolve, engines develop more power and are more efficient, integrated electronic circuits pack more components on a single chip, aircraft fly higher and faster.
- Does maintaining a “life” of this sort justify expenditures that otherwise might be used for expanded prenatal care or other preventative measures? Given all of the value judgments, ambiguities, and complexities surrounding the word “progress,” its use is avoided here unless its meaning is clearly defined.
