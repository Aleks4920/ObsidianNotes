# Chapter Synopsis
 Technology is more than simply "applied science" (chapter 1 has established this)  
 New technologies have often emerged in absence of an understanding of the applicable scientific  
principles; e.g., the steam engine  
 Scientific advance has often depended upon prior technological innovations  
The Historical Separation of Science and Technology  
 Throughout history most technologies have been developed with little scientific input; or, put  
differently, there has been an historical disconnect between technology and science... they have been  
distinctly different endeavours  
 In Ancient Greece many technological achievements were made without a full scientific understanding  
of how they worked, yet Greece’s scientific legacy (in astronomy, optics, acoustics and mathematics) is  
more significant than its technological legacy  
 Rome demonstrated a similar weak alignment between tech development and scientific knowledge;  
however Rome's greatest advances were in the area of technology (e.g., the aqueducts), not science  
Studies of Contemporary Science-Technology Relationships  
 Project Hindsight (U.S. 1960’s): Study of the effects of pure science on the development of major  
weapon systems.... results of the study revealed that pure science had very little to do with technological  
development  
 TRACES concluded, however, that a number of innovations (from oral contraceptives to VCR’s) were,  
indeed, the direct result of scientific research  
 It should be noted that, although science is often the precursor of technological innovations, the  
relationship is often non-linear... in other words, it’s complicated.  
How Technology Differs from Science  
 The two are very different in their basic nature. Science can be seen as a pursuit of knowledge for its  
own sake, whereas technology can be seen as a means to an end  
 Scientists are typically viewed as being free from the influence of politics, economy, and society more  
generally; the work of scientists is relatively open-ended, moving easily from one theory to another; the  
notion that scientific progress leads to material progress has conferred respectability on scientists

 Technicians are typically viewed as being more constrained in their work; due to the powerful demand  
for practical results, technicians cannot abandon projects as easily as scientists; technicians are under  
more severe time pressures than scientists  
 Scientists ask the question “Is it true?” They are compelled to come up with explanations  
 Technicians ask the question “Will it work?” Technology will still be relevant even if we don’t know  
how it works  
o Iron was produced for many decades before we understood the scientific principles which  
explained what was going on inside the furnace  
How Technology Facilitates Scientific Discovery  
 Scientific knowledge has often been the by-product of technological achievements  
o The development of the steam injector led to the development of a scientific theory of heat  
 However, technological developments often reach a plateau due to a lack of scientific knowledge  
Legitimating Science through Technology  
 Technology supplies devices and instruments for scientific inquiry; e.g., telescopes, galvanometers  
 Much scientific research has been funded in the hopes that it will "pay off" one day  
The Translation of Science into Technology  
 A great deal of scientific knowledge is translated into technology through the education of engineers  
 However, science can stifle technological development because of its preference for a single answer,  
whereas the history of technological development has proceeded on the premise that there is more than  
one way to skin a cat  
The Commonalities of Science and Technology  
 Both based on the gathering of knowledge  
 Both advance through cumulative development  
 Both share rational thought processes, though neither are totally rational in their scope; values,  
interpretation, and serendipity are central to both endeavors  
 Mathematics central to both  
 Both share sense of optimism and progress

# Review Questions  _Remember: Review Questions are used when setting examination questions_

1. What does the history of Greece and Rome tell us about the relationship of science and technology in the ancient world?  
	That Science doesn't necessarily correlate to technological advancement, as the romans made leaps and bounds in tech without making much in science and the Greeks made leaps in science but there technology was unrelated to there discoveries  
2. What were the chief conclusions of Project Hindsight? And TRACES?  
	Project Hindsight aimed and proved in there own study that scientific research has a much smaller correlation to technological advancement then we thought before, While project traces aimed to prove the opposite stating that many technological advancements were made in direct ties to scientific research. The issue with both of these studies is they assumed linear progression.
3. What does the story of Johannes Kepler and the beer kegs teach us about the difference between science and technology?  
	Not all discoveries are made using science, in this example he had discovered the most optimal dimensions for a beer keg, yet a company that lacked the calculus knowledge he had used to derive these dimensions were already employing them in there beer kegs. Thus they lacked the scientific knowledge but most likely came to that conclusion through trial and error
4. In what ways does technology sometimes influence scientific thought? How did the steam injector invented by Henri Giffard influence scientific thinking about the nature of heat?
	The steam injector completely turned an scientific theory on its head, changing the way people looked at the concept of head, as the steam injector would be a perpetual motion machine if under the previous theory. Under the new theory of heat it made sense. In the end the technology changed the scientific way of thinking rather then science changing tech
5. Why might the early history of the laser be considered an example of an “invention looking for an application” (or a “technology in search of a problem”)?  
	The Laser was invented due to separate research being conducted leading them to discover the technology used to create lasers without any application, until it spawned an entire field of science along with many inventions. 
6. How does Langdon Winner explain the success of science as a philosophy of inquiry? Why, according to Winner, has “social science... never fully established its credentials in the halls of science”?  
	The success of science comes from its ability to actually demonstrate  results, The reason while social science never was truly established as a science is because it lacks producing any true results and is stuck only producing an intelligible, systematic, aesthetically pleasing picture of reality like all of other philosophies. 
7. How did aerodynamics research in the 1930’s create an impetus for radical changes in aircraft power plants?  
	There new discoveries into aircrafts lead them to find aircrafts that were far more capable then the previous propeller driven ones. Thus an impetus for the development of these new jet engine
8. How has a rational approach been evident in the development of both science and technology? How might it  
	
be argued that the development of both science and technology isn’t always a strictly rational process?  
9. Under what conditions is the term “techno-science” especially appropriate? Why is the line between science  
and technology so blurred in these conditions?  
10. How may an excessive focus on science and mathematics be problematic for an engineering education?  
How may it impede technological advance in some cases?  
11. Who was John Ambrose Fleming? What was his role in advancing early radio technology?

# Required reading notes
## The Historical Sepoeration of Science and technology

- The definition of technology that was offered in the first chapter stressed that technology is based above all on the application of knowledge. But not all knowledge need be derived from scientific research.
- The ancient Greeks made important contributions to many sciences—most notably astronomy, optics, and acoustics—as well as producing major advances in mathematics. Greek technology also progressed through innovations in agriculture, building construction, mining, the refining of metals, and military equipment. Yet none of these innovations drew to any significant degree on Greek science.
- This lopsided pattern of development continued with the Romans, although in reverse. Roman contributions to science were minor, while Roman engineering (manifested in such things as the construction of great aqueducts) reached a high level of development. In any event, Roman technology had little to do with science
## Studies of Contemporary Science-Technology Relationships
- The relative unimportance of science for many technological developments was highlighted by a study that was conducted by the Defense Department in the mid-1960s. Dubbed Project Hindsight,
	- this study assessed the extent to which pure scientific research was essential to the development of 20 major weapons systems.
	- The results of the study gave little credence to the commonly accepted view that scientific knowledge is the primary basis of technological development. Of the 710 events surveyed, only 2 were the result of basic scientific research, a minuscule 0.3 percent of the total.5 Scientific research that was specifically directed toward a particular military project was of greater importance, accounting for 6.7 percent of events, while 2 percent were the result of scientific research directed toward commercial or nondefense needs. The greatest portion of events, the remaining 92 percent, owed little to concurrent scientific research, and relied almost entirely on established concepts and principles. 
- By taking a longer chronological view, another study, entitled Technology in Retrospect and Critical Events in Science (TRACES), contradicted the previously cited studies by determining that a number of innovations, ranging from oral contraceptives' to videocassette recorders, were directly tied to prior scientific research.9
## How technology Differs from Science
- If nothing else, these studies show that the connection between science and technology is not adequately captured by the common belief that technology is simply applied science, and that scientific discoveries quickly and easily give rise to technological applications
- science is directed at the discovery of knowledge for its own sake, technology develops and employs knowledge in order to get something done. The content of the knowledge may be rather similar, but different motivations underlie its pursuit and application.
- Much of the prestige accorded to science is the result of its supposed purity; science is thought to be an intellectual venture free from political, organizational, and economic constraints.
-  science has been described and analyzed as a social construction. From this standpoint, scientific inquiry is not a disinterested, fact-driven search for truth, but a human creation that has been shaped by cultural patterns, economic and political interests, and gender-based ways of seeing the world.13 For uncompromising social constructivists, successful scientific outcomes may have more to do with negotiation, the support of designated authorities, and resonance with prevailing attitudes than theoretical elegance or experimental evidence\
- In contrast, most engineers work under tighter constraints. Their employers expect results that have immediate applications and fall within a narrowly defined range of possibilities. A scientist may abandon a theory or an experiment in order to pursue a line of inquiry that unexpectedly arises during the course of his or her research.
- As we have seen, throughout history many technologies were effectively applied even though the basic principles underlying their operation were poorly understood, if they were understood at all.
- story of the great scientist Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), who developed and employed the calculus of variation in order to derive optimum dimensions of beer kegs—only to discover that these dimensions were already being employed by the coopers who actually built the kegs!
	- Many other technological innovations seem to fall into this pattern. Although scientifically derived principles may emerge after the fact, many technologies have been guided almost exclusively by trial and error, with the successful ones informed by an intuitive sense of the right solution, and not by scientific truths.
## How Technology Stimulates Scientific Discovery
- Although we tend to think of science as the leading factor in technological advance, the reverse often occurs: scientific knowledge and discovery may be a byproduct of technological achievements, as when fundamental advances in biology and chemistry were stimulated by the successful efforts of Pasteur, Lister, and Koch to solve practical medical problems.
- There also have been cases where a technology already in operation defied accepted scientific explanations and stimulated the formulation of new theories.
	- This process is exemplified by the story of how the steam injector contributed to the abandonment of a popular scientific theory regarding the nature of heat.
	- In the mid-nineteenth century, many scientists believed that heat was the result of the presence of a substance known as “caloric.” According to this theory, when caloric combined with other materials those materials became hot.
	- The injector used steam from the boiler to lift water into it, an operation that seemed to mimic perpetual motion for those who subscribed to the caloric theory.
	- Giffard’s injector was no perpetual motion machine; it used a quantity of heat that was equal to the quantity of work expended in raising water into the boiler, plus the losses due to radiation and contact with surrounding surfaces. Its operation therefore made sense only when the interconvertibility of heat and work was understood.
	- The steam injector illustrates the often subtle interactions between science and technology. The operation of the injector provided a strong stimulus for the acceptance of one scientific theory and the rejection of another. At the same time, another scientific theory had been essential to the invention of the injector.
- Many technological developments reach a plateau due to a lack of scientific knowledge, thereby generating a clearly perceived need for fundamental scientific research.
	- One example of this process is the invention of the laser. During World War II
	- In 1954 he and his co-workers created a device they called the “maser” (for “microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation”). In 1958 he and a former student published a paper that outlined how the principle of the maser could be extended into the region of infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light.
	- These ideas were the foundation for the laser (the acronym for “light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation”).
	- At first the laser was the classic example of an invention looking for an application. But in succeeding years, the laser became the basis for a host of technologies ranging from scanners used at checkout counters to devices used for the surgical rejoining of detached retinas.
	- In short, the development of one technology (radar) gave rise to scientific advance (the determination of molecular structures through microwave spectroscopy) and at the same time provided a scientific foundation for a entirely new technology (the laser).
## Indirect Effects of Technology on Scientific Advance
- Technology’s role in stimulating scientific advance does not end with the provision of data, problems, and research opportunities. Technological development also plays a vital role in scientific advance by supplying devices and instruments that are essential for scientific inquiry
- this faith in the practical consequences of scientific research has given science the immense prestige and legitimacy that it enjoys today. Many areas of scientific inquiry have become increasingly expensive propositions.
- Financial support, however important it is to the maintenance of scientific inquiry, is only part of the picture. The willingness of government agencies to grant money for scientific research and of citizens to have their taxes used in this manner is indicative of a widespread belief in the legitimacy of scientific research.
- This legitimacy is in large measure the product of the presumed ability of science to ultimately produce practical results. These ascribed powers of science have been analyzed by Langdon Winner:
	- The ultimate success of science must be accounted to its fulfillment of Baconian ambitions—the delivery of power. Other modes of knowing have been able to give an intelligible, systematic, aesthetically pleasing picture of reality
	- But in the West at least, the test is not so much what do you know? or how elegant is your interpretation of worldly phenomena? but rather, what can you actually do? This is the conclusive factor, the reason that, for instance, social science has never fully established its credentials in the halls of science.
- This expected ability of science to “deliver the goods” is somewhat paradoxical, for science as a system unto itself responds rather poorly to economic needs.
- Scientists typically create knowledge for other scientists. Their efforts are focused on the testing of theories and the solution of problems
- The transfer of knowledge from science to technology can be a subtle process, with scientific research motivating technological change by pointing out unseen problems and at the same time suggesting new opportunities.
	- This happened in the 1930s when the evolving science of aerodynamics showed how the behavior of aircraft changed dramatically at high speeds.
	- This research clearly indicated that conventional propeller-driven airplanes would encounter an insurmountable velocity barrier as they approached the speed of sound. At the same time, aerodynamic research indicated that proper streamlining could greatly increase the speed at which airplanes could fly, provided they had a different method of propulsion.
## The commonalities of Science and Technology
- More generally, science and technology have been nourished by a supportive culture at least since the days of the early Industrial Revolution. Although science provided few direct inputs into early industrialization, the values and attitudes of engineers and mechanics had much in common with those of scientists. As Peter Mathias has described this era
- Some of the basic elements of this mode of inquiry are described by Robert Pirsig in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, where he explains how even a clearly technological task like determining why a motorcycle won’t start is addressed through the use of procedures that have much in common with scientific inquiry.
- Of course, one shouldn’t take this analysis too far. Although both science and technology make heavy use of rational modes of thought, neither can be properly characterized as the embodiment of rationality
	- Scientific theories must be logically consistent and rationally articulated, but their ultimate source is human creativity and imagination—qualities often at a considerable distance from rational thought processes. At the other end of the scientific enterprise, the testing of these theories, there are no perfectly rational means of determining the criteria through which theories can be validated or disproved.
	- In similar fashion, a great deal of technological advance is also the product of nonrational thought. And, as was noted earlier, the benefit or harm of a particular technology cannot always be adjudged according to criteria based on rationally determined principles; a great deal hinges on values and ethical standards that are derived through other means.
