# Chapter Synopsis
 Technology is more than simply "applied science" (chapter 1 has established this)  
 New technologies have often emerged in absence of an understanding of the applicable scientific  
principles; e.g., the steam engine  
 Scientific advance has often depended upon prior technological innovations  
The Historical Separation of Science and Technology  
 Throughout history most technologies have been developed with little scientific input; or, put  
differently, there has been an historical disconnect between technology and science... they have been  
distinctly different endeavours  
 In Ancient Greece many technological achievements were made without a full scientific understanding  
of how they worked, yet Greece’s scientific legacy (in astronomy, optics, acoustics and mathematics) is  
more significant than its technological legacy  
 Rome demonstrated a similar weak alignment between tech development and scientific knowledge;  
however Rome's greatest advances were in the area of technology (e.g., the aqueducts), not science  
Studies of Contemporary Science-Technology Relationships  
 Project Hindsight (U.S. 1960’s): Study of the effects of pure science on the development of major  
weapon systems.... results of the study revealed that pure science had very little to do with technological  
development  
 TRACES concluded, however, that a number of innovations (from oral contraceptives to VCR’s) were,  
indeed, the direct result of scientific research  
 It should be noted that, although science is often the precursor of technological innovations, the  
relationship is often non-linear... in other words, it’s complicated.  
How Technology Differs from Science  
 The two are very different in their basic nature. Science can be seen as a pursuit of knowledge for its  
own sake, whereas technology can be seen as a means to an end  
 Scientists are typically viewed as being free from the influence of politics, economy, and society more  
generally; the work of scientists is relatively open-ended, moving easily from one theory to another; the  
notion that scientific progress leads to material progress has conferred respectability on scientists

 Technicians are typically viewed as being more constrained in their work; due to the powerful demand  
for practical results, technicians cannot abandon projects as easily as scientists; technicians are under  
more severe time pressures than scientists  
 Scientists ask the question “Is it true?” They are compelled to come up with explanations  
 Technicians ask the question “Will it work?” Technology will still be relevant even if we don’t know  
how it works  
o Iron was produced for many decades before we understood the scientific principles which  
explained what was going on inside the furnace  
How Technology Facilitates Scientific Discovery  
 Scientific knowledge has often been the by-product of technological achievements  
o The development of the steam injector led to the development of a scientific theory of heat  
 However, technological developments often reach a plateau due to a lack of scientific knowledge  
Legitimating Science through Technology  
 Technology supplies devices and instruments for scientific inquiry; e.g., telescopes, galvanometers  
 Much scientific research has been funded in the hopes that it will "pay off" one day  
The Translation of Science into Technology  
 A great deal of scientific knowledge is translated into technology through the education of engineers  
 However, science can stifle technological development because of its preference for a single answer,  
whereas the history of technological development has proceeded on the premise that there is more than  
one way to skin a cat  
The Commonalities of Science and Technology  
 Both based on the gathering of knowledge  
 Both advance through cumulative development  
 Both share rational thought processes, though neither are totally rational in their scope; values,  
interpretation, and serendipity are central to both endeavors  
 Mathematics central to both  
 Both share sense of optimism and progress

# Review Questions  _Remember: Review Questions are used when setting examination questions_

1. What does the history of Greece and Rome tell us about the relationship of science and technology in the ancient world?  
	That Science doesn't necessarily correlate to technological advancement, as the romans made leaps and bounds in tech without making much in science and the Greeks made leaps in science but there technology was unrelated to there discoveries  
2. What were the chief conclusions of Project Hindsight? And TRACES?  
3. What does the story of Johannes Kepler and the beer kegs teach us about the difference between science and  
technology?  
4. In what ways does technology sometimes influence scientific thought? How did the steam injector invented  
by Henri Giffard influence scientific thinking about the nature of heat?

5. Why might the early history of the laser be considered an example of an “invention looking for an  
application” (or a “technology in search of a problem”)?  
6. How does Langdon Winner explain the success of science as a philosophy of inquiry? Why, according to  
Winner, has “social science... never fully established its credentials in the halls of science”?  
7. How did aerodynamics research in the 1930’s create an impetus for radical changes in aircraft power plants?  
8. How has a rational approach been evident in the development of both science and technology? How might it  
be argued that the development of both science and technology isn’t always a strictly rational process?  
9. Under what conditions is the term “techno-science” especially appropriate? Why is the line between science  
and technology so blurred in these conditions?  
10. How may an excessive focus on science and mathematics be problematic for an engineering education?  
How may it impede technological advance in some cases?  
11. Who was John Ambrose Fleming? What was his role in advancing early radio technology?

## **Learning Objectives**

Upon completion of this unit of study, you should be able to:  
-  Describe, in broad strokes, the historical relationship between science and technology  
-  Describe the ways in which science differs from technology  
-  Identify the ways in which science stimulates technological development  
-  Identify ways in which technology stimulates the advance of scientific knowledge  
-  Identify the various common denominators between science and technology

## **Learning Objectives**

Upon completion of this unit of study, you should be able to address the following:

- What are the linguistic roots of the term “technology”?
- How has technology served as a _survival strategy_ for homo sapiens throughout the ages?
- How does Rudi Volti define “technology”? What are the principal components of Volti’s comprehensive definition of “technology”? (Hint: knowledge is one component). What is meant when we say that technology is a _system_?
- Complete the following sentence: “A sociology of technology examines…”. That is, articulate the basic sociological perspective on technology (hint: sociology emphasizes the social context in which technologies are developed and used).

# Required reading notes
## The Historical Sepoeration of Science and technology

- The definition of technology that was offered in the first chapter stressed that technology is based above all on the application of knowledge. But not all knowledge need be derived from scientific research.
- The ancient Greeks made important contributions to many sciences—most notably astronomy, optics, and acoustics—as well as producing major advances in mathematics. Greek technology also progressed through innovations in agriculture, building construction, mining, the refining of metals, and military equipment. Yet none of these innovations drew to any significant degree on Greek science.
- This lopsided pattern of development continued with the Romans, although in reverse. Roman contributions to science were minor, while Roman engineering (manifested in such things as the construction of great aqueducts) reached a high level of development. In any event, Roman technology had little to do with science
