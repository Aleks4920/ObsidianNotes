# **Chapter Synopsis**

**Technology as a Subversive Force**

- technology delivers benefits, and exacts costs, but not always in equal measure
    
- technology is, arguably, the greatest single source of economic growth  
    

Myths about technology:

- technology can function without altering existing social arrangements
    
- technological solutions are superior to social or political solutions
    
- some technological change is relatively insignificant, but some is massive
    
- the economy, in particular, is affected by technological change:
    
- the destruction of once vibrant economic enterprises:
    
    - Pony Express > telegraph > telephone
        
    - typesetting > computers
        
    - landline phones > cell/smartphones
        

Examples of the subversive nature of technological change:

Uber, Lyft, and Ride-sharing:

- Ride-sharing services such as Uber have rapidly evolved into significantly disruptive forces
    
- Smart phone technology has facilitated the meteoric rise of ride-sharing services
- Adverse consequences include emergence of conflict between ride-sharing interests and established transportation companies and the growth of precarious employment (e.g., Uber drivers as contractors rather than employees with benefits and security).

Caliente, Nevada:

- Small town in the U.S. Midwest built around a single technology: the steam locomotive
    
- With the introduction of the diesel-electric locomotive, the once thriving Caliente quickly vanished
    
- A similar fate awaited numerous small towns with the introduction of the Interstate highway system
    

**The Luddites**

- Ned Lud was a stocking maker who smashed stocking frames
    
- The Luddites were those workers who, in fear of their jobs, smashed machines
    
- The owners of hosiery firms wanted to use wider frames to make more hosiery for less money
    
- This allowed for the use of less skilled, cheaper labor (deskilling); the workers protested violently
    
- A bad harvest led to an increase in food costs, and workers’ pay wasn’t meeting their basic needs
    
- Luddism reflected a fear of unemployment because of technological change, not an irrational fear of machinery itself; however, but machinery, out of frustration and hunger, became the target of their rebellion
    
- Workers’ protests eventually took more peaceful forms; e.g., the formation of unions
    
- The term ‘Luddite’ has become a label for anyone who opposes the introduction of new technologies
    
- **Neo-Luddism**: an example is the recent opposition to the use of computers and their potential to replace human labor and change existing ways of doing things
    

**Whose Technology?**

- Technology does not succeed or fail solely on its intrinsic merit… social, political, economic factors play an important role
    

- Some technology succeeds because of particular group interest; e.g., atomic power industry
    
- Some technology fails because of particular group interest; e.g., AIDS research in early 1980's
    

- Technology is often very expensive (e.g., hydroelectric power) and, therefore, typically controlled by powerful groups (corporations, governments)
    
- Because technology is often sponsored by large corporations and governments, technologies often represent the interests of these groups
    

**The Technological Fix**

- The application of technical solutions to non-technical problems; for example:
    

- Heroin addiction and the development of Methadone, and now the "cocaine vaccine"
    
- Car accidents and seat belts and air bags
    
- Graffiti on public property and stronger chemicals to resist paint
    
- But none of these technological fixes address the underlying social factors
    

**Why Technology Can’t Always Fix It?**

- Social problems are fundamentally different from technological problems
    
- Technological problems usually clear and unambiguous
    
- Social problems are anything but clear; e.g., crime
    
- The causes of social problems are many and complex
    
- Technological solutions usually take place in closed systems
    
- Technological fixes often create new 'residue' problems
    

**The Appeal of Technocracy**

- Despite limitations, Technocrats still attempt to make social problems into technological ones
    
- Scientific Management (Frederick Winslow Taylor)
    
- Time and motion studies: how many motions should it take to complete a job?
    
- Managers determine amount of motions needed and workers follow unreservedly
    
- Workers benefit because they don’t waste time and managers benefit from higher yields
    
- Workers paid piecemeal, not wages and since workers are efficient they’ll earn more   
    

**The Technocrat’s Delusion**

- Scientific Management failed to take hold:
    
    - Workers resented losing what little autonomy they had
        
    - Managers also feared being governed by scientific procedures
        
    - Scientific Management only worked in workplaces characterized by repetitive-type labour processes
        
    - Considerable skills were required to conduct time & motion studies
        
    - The basic fallacy of Scientific Management is the idea that administration (the application of precise rules and procedures) can replace politics (the process by which decisions about such things as the distribution of societal rewards are made… typically involving power and conflict) 
        

# **Review Questions**

1. What is meant when Volti says that _technology is a subversive force_? Identify a few examples. 

2. Identify the various social disruptions triggered by the emergence and development of Uber. What technology was most instrumental in making Uber possible?

3. How did Caliente, Nevada, exemplify “death by dieselization”? 

4. What was the goal of the McCormick reaper manufacturing plant installing pneumatic molding machines in the 1880's? Did they achieve this goal? 

5.  What did the attempt to produce prefabricated housing in post-war Detroit have in common with the attempt by the McCormick reaper manufacturing plant to install pneumatic molding machines? Why did pre-fabricated housing in post-war Detroit fail?  

6. Who were the Luddites? Where did they live? What did they do? Why did they do it? 

7. Why did Luddite outbreaks cease by the middle of the 19th century? 

8. Name some governmental agencies that have strongly influenced the course of technological change. 

9. Why were automobiles expected to be a cure for urban problems in the 1920's? What really happened? 

10. What is meant by a ’’technological fix”? Give some examples of technological fixes and justify if they were successful or unsuccessful. 

11. What is meant by a “closed system”? How does this concept help us to understand the limitations of using technology to solve problems? 

12. Define “technocracy”. In theory, why is this form of government appealing? Why doesn’t it really work in

practice? 

13. What is meant by a “residue problem”? Give an example. (Disregard this question). 

14. Describe the basic elements of Frederick W. Taylor’s Scientific Management. Who benefited from it?  Who opposed it? 

15. How does administration differ from politics? How does this distinction help us understand the limits of technocracy?

# Required reading notes
## Winners And Losers: The Differential Effects of Technological Change
- The last chapter may have seemed a bit negative in its assessment of technology and the culture that supports it. In one regard, however, there is no denying technology’s positive consequences: technological advance has been the greatest single source of economic growth.
- . If our material lives are better than those of our grandparents, it is largely because technological development has boosted the production of goods and services.
- Curiously, economists were slow to grasp this seemingly obvious fact. Conventional economic analysis identifies three basic “factors of production”: land (which includes natural resources), labor, and capital. Any increase in production is therefore taken to be the result of an increase of these factors.
	- This view began to change in the 1950s when the historical course of economic development in the United States was analyzed through the use of sophisticated statistical techniques. It then became apparent that increases in the traditional factors of production did not adequately explain the actual record of economic growth
	- The amount of land had remained constant, and capital accumulation and increases in the labor force accounted for only 10 to 20 percent of economic growth during the first half of the twentieth century.1 Accordingly, the major source of economic growth was a “residual” factor of overwhelming importance.
## Technology as a Subversive Force
- While technological development has been the primary source of economic advance, it has not been cost-free.
- One of the most pleasant myths about technology is that it can work its wonders without altering existing social arrangements. Americans in particular have often seen technological progress as the surest basis for progress in general, and have tended to believe that technological solutions to problems are less painful than solutions that require political or social changes.2 These beliefs are not easily sustained after an examination of the actual pattern of technological advance.
- It is a truism that a particular technology can be used for either good or evil purposes; a construction team employs explosives to build a road, while a terrorist uses them for roadside bombs. But there is less appreciation for a more subtle point: technological change is often a subversive process that results in the modification or destruction of established social roles, relationships, and values.
- A few technological changes are massive, and they lead to vast social restructuring. In either case, technology does not yield its benefits without exacting a cost.
- The disruptive effects of technological change can readily be seen in the economic realm, where new technologies can lead to the destruction of obsolete firms, as when the fabled Pony Express rapidly lost its customers after telegraph wires had been strung across the West
- Many new industries and individual firms owe their existence to the emergence of a new technology. Witness, for example, the rapid growth of personal computer manufacturing, peripheral equipment production, software publishing, and app development that followed the invention of the integrated circuit.
