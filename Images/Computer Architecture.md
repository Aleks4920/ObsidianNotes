## Four Main Structural Components
![[Pasted image 20230929145056.png]]
System interconnection - provides comms to different structural components 

### CPU - Major Structural Componenets
- Control Unit 
- Arithmetic and logic unit
- Registers
- CPUT Intericonnection
	- Manages everything else together
### Multicore Computer Structure
- Central Proccessing Unit (CPU)
	- Portion that fetches and execurtes instructions
	- Has the ALU, Control unit and registers
	- Referred to as a processor in a stystem with a single processing unit
- Core
	- An individual processing unit on a processor chip 
	- May be equivalent in functionality to a CPU on a sing CPU system
	- Specialized processing unity are also refers to as cored
- Processor
	- A physicals piece of silicon containing one or more cores
	- is the computer component that intercepts and executes instructions
	- referred to as a multicore processor if it contains

### Cache Memory
- Multiple layers of memory between the processor and the main mememory
- is smaller and faster than main memory
- used to speed up memory access by placing in the cache data from the main memoey that is likley to be used in the near future
- A greater performance improvement may be obtained by using multplie levels of cache with level 1 (L1) closest to the core and addicional levels. progressivly father from the core
