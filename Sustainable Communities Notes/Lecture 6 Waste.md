# Waste Hierarchy
![[Pasted image 20231015111052.png]]
- Whole point of strategies is to avoid waste and disposal
	- Redesign products to avoid waste 
	- Reuse Gets reused in some way prolonging its life cycle
	- Recycle means changing it into something new
		- Worse because it takes energy
	- Recovery - recover energy from the material incenerate waste
	- Disposal
		- Burying materials in landfills
		- No benefit 
- Need to move beyond Reuse Reduce Recylce
	- Move to rethink/ Redesign
## Life Cycle of Assessment of a building
- Methodology of seeing a product in all parts of its life
- Look at all of the inputs in creating something
- But also look at all of the outputs when its created 
- See what type of Greenhouse gasses were emitted during its life cycle
- Can be reffered to as a Cradle To Grave 
- ![[Pasted image 20231015111616.png]]
- Can be done for any product 
	- Helps see all of the ways something can produce waste
	- Diagrams helps see where we need to cut down
### Cradle To Cradle
- Helps see somethings as circular and focus on reuse 
- Creation to Creation 
	- Rather Then creation to destruction and waste/Grave
- Everything should be recycled and reused rather then ever end up in the waste

- Cradle to Cradle is a form of circular Economy
# Waste management theories and concepts: life cycle analysis , cradle-to-cradle, circularity
# Landfills
## Impacts of Landfills
- Create large amount of environmental pollution

- Destruction of natural area 
	- Cut down and kill all of the area used by the landfill
	- Destruction of natural species
- They create a lot of natural gases 
	- When the waste in them decomposes releases the dangerous natural gases
- Leachate
	- The water that's flows through the waste I.e. from the snow, rain etc..
	- the water flows then into a river and can contaminate the water 
- Modern landfills 
	- The have gas recovery and gas trapping
	- The gas can be reused for energy 
# Waste To energy facilities
## Incineration
- Burn the waste as a fuel to make power
- Produces ash that can be reused
	- Concrete production, Metals etc....
