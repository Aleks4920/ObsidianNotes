#### Historical Roots of Environmental Justice
- a social movement
- started in the 80s due to pollution dumping of PCB companies in warren (Low income mostly black people)
- Oil and tar sand in Alberta (process creates a lot of pollution)
	- most communities in this area are indigenous
- **ENRICH Project**
	- environmental racism
