![[./Pasted image 20230914220447.png|Pasted image 20230914220447]] - green is safe, beyond that is not

- we have distrusted both the **Carbon** and **nitrogen** cycle.
	- increases carbon and nitrogen cause global warming
	- increased nitrogen causes acid rain
- we also cause biodiversity loss (since the rise of man 83% of mammals have been extinct)

#### Mitigation, adaptation, and resilience

###### Mitigation
- Reduce greenhouse gas and create sinks for the gases
###### Adaptation
- try to respond well to climate change
###### Resilience
- how well communities can respond to and adapt to change







### Ecological Footprint
- includes all the land and resources one needs to live their life
- **Carbon Footprint** includes all the trees needed to replace the carbon you use in your life
