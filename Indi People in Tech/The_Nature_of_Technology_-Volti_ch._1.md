### Required reading notes
#### Introduction
- In the decades since the second world war the rhetoric of development has lumbered through several stages, focusing on economic growth, growth with equity, basic needs, participatory development and, now, sustainable development
- A new phase is that of indigenous knowledge, Where ‘western’ social science, technological might, and institutional models - reified in monolithic ways - seem to have failed, local knowledge and technology - reified as ‘indigenous’ - are often viewed as the latest and the best strategy in the old fight against hunger, poverty and underdevelopment
- In the 1950s and 1960s, theorists of development saw indigenous and traditional knowledge as inefficient, inferior, and an obstacle to development.
	- Modernization Theorists and Marxists, advocates of indigenous knowledge underscore the promise it holds for agricultural production systems and sustainable development
#### The Rise of Indigenous Knowledge
````
Ten years ago, most of the academics working in the area of indigenous knowledge represented anthropology, development sociology, and geography. Today . . . important contributions are also being made in the fields of ecology, soil science, veterinary medicine, forestry, human health, aquatic science, management, botany, zoology, agronomy, agricultural economics, rural sociology, mathematics, . . . fisheries, range management, information science, wildlife management, and water resource management
````
- New international and national institutions sponsor inquiries into indigenous knowledge. Funding agencies attempt to incorporate issues related to indigenous knowledge in their financial activities (CIDA, IDRC, UNESCO and the World Bank come to mind as examples). Newsletters, journals and other mouthpieces emphasize the significance of indigenous knowledge. In numerous conferences, scholars and development professionals discuss the merits of indigenous knowledge and deploy a new populist rhetoric to assert the relevance of indigenous knowledge in development
- Indigenous knowledge forms the capstone of several convergent trends in social science thinking and development administration practice. In the past few years, with the failure of the grand theories of development, the focus in most of the social sciences has altered to favor middle-range theories that are site- and time-specific
- The science of development studies seems to be in disarray due to lack of development in third world countries due to there intense contributions
	- they collectively channel more development aid to the South than the World Bank and the IMF put together
- The failure of the externally introduced development has led them to implement new participatory and decentralized motif in development. 
	- Insofar as the populist rhetoric of indigenous knowledge also emphasizes the capacities of the underprivileged, the local, and the under-represented, and stresses the need to secure the participation of indigenous and local groups, it fits in admirably with emergent themes in development studies and administration.
- The other reason Indigenous knowledge is becoming more popular is because neo-indigenistas often talk about ‘empowering’ marginalized groups, they seldom emphasize that significant shifts in existing power relationships are crucial to development

#### What is New About Indigenous Knowledge
````
Warren outlines the following characteristics of indigenous knowledge in a paper prepared for the World Bank

indigenous knowledge is an important natural resource that can facilitate the development process in cost-effective, participatory, and sustainable ways (Vanek, 1989; Hansen and Erbaugh, 1987). Indigenous knowledge (IK) is local knowledge-knowledge that is unique to a given culture or society. IK contrasts with the international knowledge system generated by universities, research institutions and private firms. It is the basis for local-level decisionmaking in agriculture, health care, food preparation, education, natural resource management, and a host of other activities in rural communities. Such knowledge is passed down from generation to generation, in many societies by word of mouth. Indigenous knowledge has value not only for the culture in which it evolves, but also for scientists and planners striving to improve conditions in rural localities. (Warren, 1991: 1)
````
- The primary dimension of difference and uniqueness, according to Warren, seems to fie in an organic relationship between the local community and its Indigenous knowledge, therefore, is of crucial significance if one wishes to introduce a cost-effective, participatory and sustainable development process.
````
Modern scientific knowledge is centralized and associated with the machinery of the state; and those who are its bearers believe in its superiority. Indigenous technical knowledge, in contrast, is scattered and associated with low prestige rural life; even those who are its bearers may believe it to be inferior. (Warren, 1989: 162)
````
- Howes and Chambers, referring to indigenous knowledge as indigenous technical knowledge (ITK), prefer to differentiate it from scientific knowledge on methodological, rather than substantive grounds
````
An important difference between science and ITK lies in the way in which phenomena are observed and ordered. The scientific mode of thought is characterized by a greater ability to break down data presented to the senses and to reassemble it in different ways. The mode of ITK, on the other hand, is ‘concrete’ and relies almost exclusively on intuition and evidence directly available to the senses. A second distinction derives from the way practitioners to the two modes of thought represent to themselves the nature of the enterprise in which they are engaged. Science is an open system whose adherents are always aware of the possibility of alternative perspectives to those adopted to any particular point of time. ITK, on the other hand, as a closed system, is characterized by a lack of awareness that there may be other ways of regarding the world. (Howes and Chambers, 1980 330)
````
- ITK changes only to solve minor puzzles which can be compared to 'normal science'. 
	- But ITK is still, allegedly, different from science because the latter ‘constantly carries with it the possibility of “revolutionary change” in which one paradigm would be destroyed by another’
- Dei defines indigenous knowledge as the ‘common sense knowledge and ideas of local peoples about the everyday realities of living’:
````
It [indigenous knowledge] includes the cultural traditions, values, beliefs, and worldviews of local peoples as distinguished from Western scientific knowledge. Such local knowledge is the product of indigenous peoples’ direct experience of the workings of nature and its relationship with the social world. It is also a holistic and inclusive form of knowledge. (Dei, 1993: 105)
````

````
A more comprehensive discussion of differences is available in Banuri and ApffelMarglin (1993), based on an earlier volume by Apffel-Marglin and Marglin (1990). Using a ‘systems of knowledge’ framework, they find the distinguishing characteristics of indigenous knowledge (which they call traditional knowledge) to be situated in the facts that: 1) it is embedded in its particular community; 2) it is contextually bound; 3) it does not believe in individualist values; 4) it does not create a subject/object dichotomy; and 5) it requires a commitment to the local context, unlike western knowledge which values mobility and weakens local roots (Banuri and Apfell-Marglin, 1993: 10-18).
````
- The major themes that separate western knowledge from indigenous can be summarized as 
	- 1) substantive-there are differences in the subject matter and characteristics of indigenous vs. western knowledge; 2) methodological and epistemological - the two forms of knowledge employ different methods to investigate reality, and possess different world-views; and 3) contextual - traditional and western knowledge differ because traditional knowledge is more deeply rooted in its context.
````
‘Development from below’ is for many reasons, a more productive approach than that from above, and ... an essential ingredient is indigenous knowledge .. . To incorporate in developmental planning indigenous knowledge: is a courtesy to the people concerned; is an essential first step to successful development; emphasizes human needs and resources, rather than material ones alone; makes possible the adaptation of technology to local needs; is the most efficient way of using western ‘Research and Development’ in developing countries; preserves valuable local knowledge; encourages community self-diagnosis and heightens awareness; leads to a healthy local pride; can use local skills in monitoring and early warning systems; involves the users in feedback systems, for example, on crop varieties. These positive reasons- together with the negative reasons, such as the likelihood of failure without using indigenous knowledge-constitute a strong case for incorporating this knowledge in development programs (Brokensha et al., 1980: 74).

## Textbook Reading Notes

### Required reading Review Questions

**Review Questions**

1.  According to Agrawal, why has _indigenous knowledge_ become so popular in the rhetoric of economic and social development in recent years? (p. 413)

2.  How was indigenous knowledge viewed in the 1950’s and 1960’s? (p.413)

3.  Identify recent examples/evidence of the increasing use of indigenous knowledge by academics/scientists, developmental practitioners, government administrators, journalists, and so on. (p. 415)  

4.  The principal objective in reading Agrawal’s article is to achieve a basic understanding of the fundamental differences between indigenous and western/scientific ways of knowing. Read pages 416-20 and identify the characteristics of western/scientific ways of knowing. Also identify the characteristics of traditional, indigenous ways of knowing. You might find it helpful to prepare a table.  

5.  In a few sentences, why have rational, western ways of knowing failed to achieve economic and social development which is equitable and sustainable? How might the characteristics of traditional indigenous knowledge compensate for these shortcomings?
