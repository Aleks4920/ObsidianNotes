**Learning Objectives**

Upon completion of this unit of study, you should be able to address the following:

- What are the linguistic roots of the term “technology”?
- How has technology served as a _survival strategy_ for homo sapiens throughout the ages?
- How does Rudi Volti define “technology”? What are the principal components of Volti’s comprehensive definition of “technology”? (Hint: knowledge is one component). What is meant when we say that technology is a _system_?
- Complete the following sentence: “A sociology of technology examines…”. That is, articulate the basic sociological perspective on technology (hint: sociology emphasizes the social context in which technologies are developed and used).
- Why is technology often equated with social progress? (hint: think of the development of technology as a cumulative and dynamic process)
- In what ways is the creation of technologies a rational approach to problem solving (as opposed to the more traditional means of dealing with problems in earlier historical periods)?
- Describe _technological determinism_ as a theoretical perspective re: technology and society.
- Describe _social constructivism_ as a theoretical perspective re: technological change.

**Chapter Synopsis**

**Defining Technology**

- _technology_ is a relatively new term, first published in the 1820’s by Jacob Bigelow (Harvard University)
- the word _technology_ can be traced back to the Greek language, where it can be broken down into 2 parts:

- _tekne_ meaning the art of doing/making something… it didn’t refer to an object (a noun), but rather a craft or skill (a verb)
- _logos_ originally meaning “informed discourse or debate”, and later simply “knowledge” 

- technologies have historically been invented to help us do things we otherwise couldn’t accomplish, thereby making up for our lack of other traits; as a species, we’re not particularly strong, or fast, and we can’t fly, or breathe under water, but we can use our imagination and create technology
- our ability to create and use technology sets us apart from non-humans; in particular, our ability to engage in abstract thought (imagination, creativity, and abstraction have allowed us to create technologies)
- our reliance on technology dates back 100’s of thousands of years to the early period of simple tool technologies (tools made of stone, bone and wood… knives, scrapers, arrow heads, lodge pools, etc.)
- As Marshall McLuhan said: “First we shape our technologies, and then they shape us,” …this reflects the _reciprocal relationship_ between our technologies and our social organization/behaviours

- technologies have made the survival of the human race possible

**Technology:** _A system based on the application of knowledge, manifested in physical objects and organization forms, for the attainment of specific goals_

- Technology is a _system_ comprised of the following elements:

- artifacts (cars, cameras, computers, candles, calculators, couches…)
- knowledge (the knowledge required to design and make technologies)
- technique (the skills required to use and maintain technologies, or sometimes _technique_ refers to a way of doing something which may not necessarily involve a technological artifact of any kind; e.g., crop rotation methods
- organization (the social relations required to maintain technologies)
- try to identify several examples of social relationships bound-up with e.g., the private automobile

- Volti’s definition of _technology_ has its limitations:

- it assumes technology comes about in order to meet existing needs… this is not always the case
- the history of technology is littered with examples of inventions looking for problems to solve; e.g., aspirin
- new technologies often create new needs and new problems
- goals achieved through technology are not always practical ones satisfying pressing human needs; e.g., new technologies often developed as status symbols, or frivolous entertainment    

**Technological Advance and the Image of Progress**

- the development of technology is an inherently _dynamic and cumulative process_

- technological change is one of continuous improvement of existing technologies
- this dynamic, progressive element of technology makes it a unique human endeavour (unlike other human endeavours such as art, literature, and music where it is hard to measure ‘progress’)   

- some societies may be advanced technologically but not in other areas such as the distribution of goods and services and the delivery of social justice

- Nazi Germany developed the Mercedes and other impressive technologies, but murdered millions of Jews
- pre-literate societies had simple technologies, but advanced artistry and social relationships

- the notion of _progress_ is complex and can only be understood in the context of a given set of cultural beliefs and values

**Technology as a Metaphor**

- _technology_ has been employed as a metaphor; e.g., technology as social progress
- technology has shaped the way we think about ourselves and our world; e.g., the technological principle of _feedback_ (e.g., James Watt’s _flyball governor_ designed to automatically regulate the speed of a steam engine) has been incorporated into other areas of social life; e.g., the stock market; policy analysis, etc.

**Technology and Rationality**  

- a _technologically progressive society_ has come to mean one in which problems can be managed in a rational way… can be studied systematically and where solutions to problems can always be found
- however, rational modes of thought do not necessarily confer moral superiority

- in fact, extreme rational thought can result in tragic moral transgressions (e.g., Nazi Germany and the Holocaust)

- rationality requires objectivity

**Technological Determinism**

- a theoretical perspective re: social change which assigns priority to technological factors
- promotes the idea that technological development is out-of-control… technology has a ‘life of its own’
- there is no doubt that technology does impact on individuals and society, but the direction and pace of technological development is influenced by many social, economic, political (etc.) factors
- _Social Constructivism_ is the theoretical perspective re: social change which assigns priority to socio-cultural factors and human agency

**Living in a Technological Society**

- modern technology is accessible in some form to the entire population yet, by its very nature, few people actually understand it; our lack of understanding can render us somewhat powerless over our technologies and feeling somewhat alienated. Can you think of examples of technologically-induced alienation in your own life?

**Review Questions**  _Remember: Review Questions are used when setting examination questions_

1. Define _technology_ (identify its principal components). What are some of the limitations of this definition? 

2. The word “technology” comes from the ancient Indo-European word _tekhn_. Describe the evolution of this word from its Greek roots to its first modern application. 

3. Reliance on today’s advanced technologies has been criticized as being “unnatural”. Is this a fair criticism? Why or why not? 

4. Why is _social_ _organization_ considered to be an essential component of technology? Give an example of a _complementary relationship_ between social organization and technology. 

5. How does the history of high-speed aircraft illustrate the process by which new technologies emerge? 

6. For the incandescent light bulb to be a commercial success there had to be a complementary structure in place to support it. What were the key elements of the system that Thomas Edison created? 

7. How does the history of the pen exemplify some key aspects of technological change? Explain the transition from the _organic_ to the _industrial_ and how it represents overall technological change. 

8. What is a _sigmoid curve_? How is the curve relevant to the course of technological change? 

9. Give an example of a technology that seems to embody progress. According to what standards may it be deemed progressive? 

10. Give an example of a technology where its contribution to overall progress is ambiguous at best. 

11. What, in a technical sense, is meant by “feedback”? Note a particular technology that makes use of the feedback principle. Give an example of how “feedback” has entered the social realm. 

12. What is meant by _rationality_? How is it connected to the development of technology? How does it relate to the way Max Weber used the word “disenchantment”? 

13. What is meant by _technological determinism_? What is meant by _social constructivism_? Why is neither fully adequate to the task of describing the nature of technology?
